# ADA (Algorithm Design and Analysis)

## Introduction 
&nbsp; For this courseâ€™s group assignment project, we decided to choose question 2. 
Question 2 concerns a UK broker looking for industrial investment opportunities in the cities 
of Asia. He already invested in a company in Kuala Lumpur and now he plans to travel to 
several cities in Asia from Kuala Lumpur to expand his investment. The cities include Jakarta, 
Bangkok, Taipei, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul. Ben decided to focus more on the 
possibilities of better return of investment in cities which have a positive economy and 
financial growth. So, Ben needs to do some analysis of the local economy and finance 
situation for the last 3 months. Furthermore, he needs to optimise his travel. He will give 
priority to cities with possible better investment return based on the analysis of local 
economic and financial situations. If the next nearest city to be visited has a less better 
economic and financial situation than any of the other cities, Ben will visit another city first 
provided that the difference of distance between the 2 cities is not more than 40% and the 
difference of sentiment analysis between the 2 cities is not less than 2%. 

<br>&nbsp;  Throughout this project, several algorithms were used; with some being implemented 
or adapted to fit different problem cases. Among them were a couple algorithms not learnt 
in this course. For certain sub-problems, the various problem-solving techniques and 
algorithm implementations taught throughout this WIA2005 Algorithm Design and Analysis 
were adapted and modified to meet the requirements of those problems. In addition to that, 
various external libraries and APIs were used in addition to the native Python libraries to help 
solve the various problems in this project. Workloads were delegated equally among the 5 
group members with
