## Introduction 
This Python program was developed as part of of a group project in fulfilment of the course requirements for WIA2005 Algorithms Design and Analysis. The objective of the program was to optimally solve 3 problems with various algorithms based on a myriad of factors, from their types to their time complexities. for the full report, pleae refer to the project report ("WI2005 Project Report.pdf") included in this repository.

## Problem Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Problem 1: Ben Sherman is a UK broker who is looking for industrial investment opportunities in the cities of Asia. He already invested in a company in Kuala Lumpur and now he plans to travel to several cities in Asia from Kuala Lumpur to expand his investment. The cities include Jakarta, Bangkok, Taipei, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul. 

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Problem 2: Ben decided to focus more on the possibilities of better return of investment in cities which has a positive economy and financial growth. So, Ben needs to do some analysis of local economy and finance situation for the last 3 months.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Problem 3: Ben realised that he needs to optimise his travel. He will give priority to cities with possible better investment return based on the analysis of local economic and financial situation. If next nearest city to be visited have less better economic and financial situation than any of the other cities, Ben will visit other city first provided that the difference of distance between the 2 cities is not more than 40% and the difference of sentiment analysis between the 2 cities is not less than 2%.
